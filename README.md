**THEORY**

**JK Flip-Flop**

JK flip-flop is the modified version of SR flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of JK flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs J & K and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of JK flip-flop is similar to SR flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of SR flip-flop as S = J Qtt’ and R = KQtt in order to utilize the modified SR flip-flop for 4 combinations of inputs. The following table shows the state table of JK flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, JK flip-flop can be used for one of these four functions such as Hold, Reset, Set & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of JK flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. Three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)

**Procedure**
```
1 Type the program in Quartus software.
2 compile and the reun the program.
3 Generate the RTL schematic and save the logic diagram.
4 create nodes for inputs and outputs to generate the timing diagram.
5 For different inuput combinations generate the timing diagram.
```
**PROGRAM**
```
module jk_ff (j, k, clk, rst, q);
  input j, k, clk, rst;
  output reg q;
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
    else if (j == 0 && k == 0)
      q <= q; // No change
    else if (j == 0 && k == 1)
      q <= 0; // Reset
    else if (j == 1 && k == 0)
      q <= 1; // Set
    else if (j == 1 && k == 1)
      q <= ~q; // Toggle
  end
```
